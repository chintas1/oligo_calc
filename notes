//Questions:
1. How is fragment size calculated and can fragments be uneven in length?

2. %’s for target amino acid is number of the target variant over the number of variants of that amino acid in the sequence? Relative % for variants of the amino acid must be kept stable even through swaps?

3. Got following %’s using example talked about and testing with sequence in the notes file:

E [(0, 1), (3, 5)]{⟨0, 1, 2⟩, ⟨0, 3⟩} Delta = 15%

31.25% in section [0,1], 0% in section [2], 43.75% in section [3..5],
25.0% in section [6..9] (notes say to consider this as 10%)

Design would produce 10%, 25%, 40%, 55%, 70%, 85% (matches initial inputs)

– Why is last section considered 10% even though it contains 25%? (Do we manually reduce it to 10%?)
– Design is always split into 4 sections with 2 sections having frequencies varied?

4. Modifying %’s
– How to reduce percent to 0 delta when there are target amino acids in the overlap
– % rounding buffer
– go as close to % without exceeding?
– minimize % difference from target %?
– How to increase % if % is less than target even after replacing all variants with target aa?
– Replace non variant with target aa?

5. Unique Overlap’s
– Do all overlaps in an oligo have to be unique or all corresponding overlaps between oligo’s have to be unique?

6. Can I assume the following inputs are given?
– DNA Seq
– Target Amino Acid (Codon)
– Design (deltas and fragments) in following format [(0, 1), (3, 5)] {⟨0, 1, 2⟩, ⟨0, 3⟩}
– # of Fragments
– Fragment Size (in aas)
– Overlap Size (in aas)
– Delta

7. Is correct output going to be x dna sequences where x is number of possible
frequency combinations from design?
